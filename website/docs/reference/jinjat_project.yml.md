:::info jinjat_project.yml
Jinjat uses dbt under the hood which requires `dbt_project.yml` file. This file is also used by Jinjat for the project version and name. `jinjat_project.yml` is different than this file and it's optional.
:::

`jinjat_project.yml` includes metadata about your dbt project that is relevant to Jinjat. While it's optional, it's recommended. Here are the list of configurations available:

<File name='jinjat_project.yml'>

```yml
[query](#query):
  max_limit: <50000>
  default_limit: <1000>

refine:
  [importmap](#import-map):
    - "https://www.unpkg.com/@mui/material@5.11.15"
  [jsonforms](#jsonforms):
    renderers:
      rating: "@mui/material/Rating"

[openapi](openapi#project-configs):

```

</File>

### Query

By default, Jinjat passes your queries to [`limit_query`](https://github.com/jinjat-data/dbt_jinjat#limit_query-source) macro before executing them in your database. You can override the default settings using the `query` parameter.

### Import Map

You can import packages from NPM or local environment via node_modules to the Refine app generated by Jinjat using Import Map feature. The packages can be used for rendering custom elements or including your custom Javascript plugins for analytics, etc. The feature is backed by Import Maps natively available in modern browser, you can read more about the URLs that you can pass [here](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps).

### JsonForms

Jinjat's Refine integration uses [JsonForms](https://jsonforms.io) to render layout from your JSON Schema definitions. Once you imported your package with [Import Map](#import-map), you can use `renderer` property to define your custom components such as `rating` defined above. The imported component needs to be a React component that has `value` for emitting the current value and `setValue` callback to set the values for the component.
