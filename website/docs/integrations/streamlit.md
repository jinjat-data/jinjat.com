Jinjat has an embedded Streamlit app that plugs in your local dbt projects. It can be used as an IDE or a data app that uses dbt exposures without any need to write Python code. The integration includes:

 * An IDE that lets you interact with Admin API to generate analyses with SQL Editor.
 * A page for each of your dbt analysis that has a form in it. The result is displayed in a table.


Usage:

```bash
jinjat streamlit
```
